### Keep Track of the Multitude of Students You've Taught

Can't keep track of all the students you've taught over the years?
Frustrated by how they all seem to know your name and you can't recall theirs?

Gather simple information about them quickly and easily, associating a name
with a face (if possible), a first class, a prefered pose, or any other
information that will help you set them apart.
